\section{Overview}
The skeleton of this talk should be the following
\begin{enumerate}
\item Introduction to classification, types of algorithms
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Rule-based
	\item Generative
	\item Discriminative
	\item Unsupervised
\end{enumerate}
\item Theoretical results
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Not really possible in a broad sense
	\item Maybe possible for generative models
\end{enumerate}

\section{Introduction}

The general problem of classification algorithms is that we have data that falls into various classes, and we would like to automatically sort them into their respective classes. For example
\begin{itemize}
\item Identifying junk mail
\item Dialect detection
\item others
\end{itemize}
We may want to do this automatically for various reasons, but we're going to assume that one reason is that there is far too much data to sort by hand, meaning we have practically unlimited unlabelled data. Classification algorithms do require some amount of labelled data (to actually be able to define the classes), but we're going to try to use as little as possible. Now, there are various types of classification algorithms, distinguished by how they make their classification judgements: Rule-based, Generative, Discriminative, and Unsupervised.
